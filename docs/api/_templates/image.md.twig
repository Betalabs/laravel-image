{% block description %}
The Image Manager is the main entry point to interact with image.

You can access it with the facade:
```php
Image::method();
```

With the app helper:
```php
app('image')->method();
```

Or with the image helper:
```php
image()->method();

// Passing arguments is an alias to image()->make()
$image = image('path/to/image.jpg', 300, 300);
```

For this documentation, we will be using the facade, but any call can be changed to `app('image')`
